# Deep Reinforcement Learning Implementations

This project is a school project for the 5th year Deep Reinforcement Learning subject at @ESGI. By doing this project we learned a lot about the Rust language, the `tch-rs` library and the functioning of the most famous deep reinforcement learning models.
